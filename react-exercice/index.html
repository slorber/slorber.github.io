  <p>
    It is <b>very important</b> that you read these instructions carefully and take <b>at least 5 minutes to play with the app</b> on the left.<br/>
    We receive many submissions where candidates clearly did not play enough with the app to notice subtilities, or thought they were bugs, or did not report in the submission email what they choose to leave unimplemented.<br/>
    As you can guess, we prefer candidates that are able to read and follow clearly defined instructions.<br/>
  </p>
  
  <h1>Exercice instructions</h1>
  <p>
    The purpose of this exercice is to reproduce the <b>exact behavior</b> of the application on the right (<b>including potential bugs</b>).<br/>
    Try to find the very little details of the app and take time to play with it.</br>
    To submit your solution, you will have to fork the following <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/qqd8LayL/">JsFiddle</a> template, and send us your JsFiddle fork url for review.<br/>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Note that finishing this exercice is not a requirement! We don't really expect you to finish all this successfully if you have never used React before. Do the most you can with the time you can invest in it and your current level. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>IMPORTANT</b>: your submission email MUST include you choose to leave unimplemented (weither it's because of lack of time, difficulty...): this will help us evaluate your sense of observation.<br/>
  </p>

  <p>
    The point of this exercice is to test your capacity to learn new technologies (if they are new to you), your motivation to join us, and your sense of observation and details. 
    If you notice some behavior that seems weird/unexpected into the app, this is NOT a bug, it has been done on purpose and you will have to implement this behavior as well, or at least report it.
  </p>


  <p>
    You will have to use the following technologies.
    <ul>
      <li>ReactJS (with JSX syntax, preferable ES6)</li>
      <li>Underscore</li>
      <li>LESS</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Please try to use these technologies the way they are supposed to be. When using LESS, use nesting and modern CSS (no floats). When using React/Underscore, try to use a functional programming approach the most you can.
  </p>
  
  <h1>After submit</h1>
  
  <p>
    We know this exercice is hard and time-consuming for a React beginner<br/>
    If you perform bad but took the time to try, we will help you understand what you did wrong.
    If you perform well, we are likely to make you a good offer.
  </p>  
  <p>
    We don't care so much about your diplomas and past experience, as long as you are a talented developer. 
    We don't mind hire talented self-made college dropoups with a decent salary!
  </p>
