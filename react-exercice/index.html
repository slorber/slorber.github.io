  <h1>Exercice instructions</h1>
  <p>
    The purpose of this exercice is to reproduce the exact behavior of the application on the right. 
    To submit your solution, you will have to fork the following <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/qqd8LayL/">JsFiddle</a> template, and send us your JsFiddle fork url for review.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that finishing this exercice is not a requirement! We don't really expect you to finish all this successfully if you have never used React before. Do the most you can with the time you can invest in it and your current level. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The point of this exercice is to test your capacity to learn new technologies (if they are new to you), your motivation to join us, and your sense of observation and details. 
    If you notice some behavior that seems weird/unexpected into the app, this is NOT a bug, it has been done on purpose and you will have to implement this behavior as well, or at least report it.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you submit a partial solution, please detail in the submission email all the things you did not implement: this will help us evaluate your sense of observation.
    You have to ask yourself questions like "is the app state persisted?", or "is the app responsive?". Try to find the very little details of the app.
  </p>


  <p>
    You will have to use the following technologies.
    <ul>
      <li>ReactJS (with JSX syntax, preferable ES6)</li>
      <li>Underscore</li>
      <li>LESS</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Please try to use these technologies the way they are supposed to be. When using LESS, use nesting and modern CSS (no floats). When using React/Underscore, try to use a functional programming approach the most you can.
